        <p><i>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is divided into three lanes, Top, Middle, and Bottom. Each lane has minions that push toward the enemy’s base, and players need to farm them for gold and experience.
		The main objective is to destroy the enemy’s towers and base while protecting your own. Who every reaches or destroys the main tower wins the game.
		As a beginner, it’s important to understand your hero’s role, whether it’s a tank, marksman, mage, support, or assassin, and focus on objectives rather than just chasing kills.</i></p> <!-- Contains the Paragraph and Italic Style -->
